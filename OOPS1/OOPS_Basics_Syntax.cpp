// We have made a class which is blueprint which defines property and functions
// of a particular object
// We don't have to define again and again the property and functions of
// objects. We just simple create a class and all the object copy this template
// (or class) and set values.

// class Student having two property
class Student {
public:
  int rollNumber;
  int age;
};

// class Product having three property
class Product {
public:
  int id;
  int weight;
  char name[100];
};
